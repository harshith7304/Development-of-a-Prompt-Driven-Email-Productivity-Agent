    "body": "Hi Team,\n\nI've reviewed the preliminary deck for the Q4 strategy meeting, and we need to make some significant adjustments before the board review on Friday.\n\n1. The revenue projections for the APAC region seem overly optimistic. Please double-check the conversion rates we're assuming for the new product launch.\n2. We need a more detailed breakdown of the marketing budget. The current slide is too high-level.\n3. The competitive analysis section is missing the latest data on Competitor X's recent acquisition.\n\nPlease have these updates ready by EOD tomorrow. We will do a dry run on Thursday morning.\n\nAlso, remind me to discuss the hiring plan for the engineering team. We need to close those open reqs before the holiday freeze.\n\nThanks,\nBoss",
